Dynamic Rotator .NET Installation Guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic Rotator can be configured two ways:
a) at design time using Visual Studio Designer (or manually adjust the server tag attributes)
b) at runtime by providing Dynamic Rotator .NET with a connection string and then accessing the Web Administration Console


Design time support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eiher:

A. Put avt.DynamicRotator.Net.dll in your Visual Studio toolbox

    In Visual Studio, open the Toolbox, right click a tab and select Choose Items...
    In the window that open select .Net Framework Components tab and browse for avt.DynamiRotator.Net.dll file (you need to unpack the package downloaded from our website first).
    Now you should see the control in the toolbox. Drag it to the page.

B. Manually register Dynamic Rotator .NET

    Add a reference to avt.DynamicRotator.Net.dll to your Web Application project.
    If it's a website project simply copy the DLL to your website /bin folder.
    Open the aspx page or the ascx user control where you want to add the rotator and register the server tag at the top of the file right after the @Page or @Control directive:

    <%@ Register assembly="avt.DynamicFlashRotator.Net" namespace="avt.DynamicFlashRotator.Net" tagprefix="cc1" %>

    Then, instantiate the server control to initialize with default settings:

    <cc1:DynamicRotator ID="dynRotator" runat="server"></cc1:DynamicRotator>

    
Runtime support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable runtime configuration:

   1. In the zip package you downloaded there should be a folder called WebManage. Copy this folder to your website and rename it to something descriptive. 
      We recommend copying it under /Controls/Rotator because this is the default path.
      Also, make sure to copy the 2 DLL files if the root folder to your website /bin folder (or add them as a reference to your project)

   2. In the zip package there's also a WebManage-Sql folder. Open the readme.txt file and execute appropriate SQL queries in order to create the database tables.

   3. In Visual Studio Designer select the Dynamic Rotator element and set Enable Runtime Configuration to true (or manually set the attribute AllowRuntimeConfiguration="True") as show in screenshot below:

   4. Let Dynamic Rotator know how to connect to the database by specifying a the name of a connection string from web.config and optionally the database owner and object qualifier.

   5. Provide path to the ManageRotator.aspx file (that you copied to your website at step 1) - the default is ~/Controls/Rotator/ManageRotator.aspx.

   6. Optionally, provide the path to the resources folder. This is used by Dynamic Rotator .NET to present administrations with a list of images to choose from and add them to slides. If not specified, Dynamic Rotator starts from the root of the website.

   7. Open the page in browser and you should see the Manage Links under the rotator as show in next image:
      Clicking the manage links will open the Web Administration Console where you can add slides, images, text and so on.

   8. You're almost done! Go to the front page and you should see the link to the manage screen.
      The only thing left is to enforce security. Right now everybody is able to edit the configuration and you'll want to enforce this.
